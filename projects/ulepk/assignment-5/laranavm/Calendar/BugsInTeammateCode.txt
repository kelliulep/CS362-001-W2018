Bug 1: toString() outputs incorrect string representation of a date in Appt.

Cause: toString meant to concatenate the variables but ended up adding the variables instead to be represented as 1 number.
The test created an appointment with the date expected to be shown as 12/1/2018 but the function represented it as 2031.
The bug was first found using the test testToString() from ApptTest, and again from testToString2().


Bug 2: represntationApp() returns the incorrect time representation of the appointment.
Cause: There is an incorrect formatting of the appointment. The “am” and “pm” strings are switched.
This is a problem that lies in the private function represntationApp() called by toString() in Appt
The bug was found using the testToString() from ApptTest and the testToString2() function from CalDayTest.

Bug 3:
Symptom: deleteAppt() in TimeTable does not delete an Appt properly.
Cause: The for loop is deleteAppt() is not executing for the proper amount of times or finding the appointment to delete.

The bug was found using testDelete2() from TimeTableTest. The test was set up add 2 appointments to a Appt LinkedList.
Then it deletes the last added appointment and the first added appointment.
The assertion to check the size after deleting the last added appointment failed - the appointment did not delete properly and the size did not decrease.
After trying to delete both of the appointments, the size shows that only one got deleted.
Severity/Priority: It is severe because it only does not work properly for some cases
